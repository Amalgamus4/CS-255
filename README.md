CS-255 System Analysis and Design

Students will explore the principles, methods, and techniques used in systems development so that they can create system models using appropriate industry tools.
As a part of creating system models, students will also learn to effectively communicate technical concepts and design decisions to various audiences in a professional manner.

- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The DriverPass project was intiated by the client, DriverPass. The client saw an issue where a large number of people were failing the driving test at the DMV. DriverPass wanted to create a system to help aspiring drivers pass their driving tests. They wanted a system that could help to manage their driving instruction sessions as well as provide online training and practice exams. 

- What did you do particularly well? 

I feel that I did a good job documenting the client’s requirements based on the transcribed interview. I was able to take notes on what the client requested, filter out extraneous data, and develop a concise summary of the client’s needs for the project. 

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

If I were to choose a part of my documents to revise, I would revise my class diagram. I feel this diagram was lacking in substance and did not fully capture the functionality needed to design the system. I would spend more time deliberating the potential classes that could be included and really expand the classes to encompass all the requested design elements. 

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I interpreted the user’s needs by looking at the potential use cases for the system. This helped determine what each user of the system would need to do and drove the design of the system. It is important to consider the user’s needs because users are the one who will be using the system. Without considering their needs, you would just be blindly adding features that may not even be useful. But, by taking time to understand users’ needs, you can fully develop a system that is functional and provides value to the client and all system users. 

- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

In the past, I have taken a cavalier approach to designing systems. I would just start trying to code something and see what happened, constantly making changes and updates as I slowly progressed. Thanks to this course, I have learned the importance of taking time to design a system ahead of development to minimize the time needed to write code. System analysis and design also helps with generating the necessary documentation that will serve as a safeguard against scope creep and changing client requirements.
